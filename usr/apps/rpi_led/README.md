# rpi_led
Raspberry Pi app demonstrating how to control an LED using General Purpose I/O (GPIO) pins. This app can be used as a starting point for more sophisticated apps that control an external device. See [RPI_BTN](https://github.com/cfs-apps/rpi_btn) as an example of processing input from an external device.
